Anytime the datapacks or resourcepack is updated, head over to the Actions tab and select the most recent job. You can download the new zip from there. You can also run any of the jobs manually.
The mods are finicky but should be rarely touched at this point. If you for some reason ever update them (You shouldn't need to) just let Nyx know.
